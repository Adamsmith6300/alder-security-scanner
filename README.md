# Alder Security Scanner

An AI-powered security analysis tool for web applications that combines Large Language Model (LLM) analysis with intelligent agent-based verification to identify and validate security vulnerabilities in your codebase.

## üîç Overview

Alder Security Scanner uses Google's Gemini AI to perform comprehensive security analysis across multiple vulnerability categories, then employs a sophisticated agent workflow to verify findings and reduce false positives. The scanner provides detailed reports with exploitability assessments, business impact analysis, and actionable remediation steps.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverages Google Gemini 2.5 Pro for deep code understanding and vulnerability detection
- **Agent-Based Verification**: Multi-stage verification workflow that assesses exploitability, context, and impact
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Analyzes 10 security categories including injection, XSS, authentication, authorization, and more
- **Smart Code Processing**: Uses Tree-sitter AST parsing for accurate code chunking and analysis
- **Vector Database Integration**: Efficient code retrieval using ChromaDB for contextual analysis
- **Cost Management**: Built-in cost tracking and limits to control LLM API usage
- **Multiple Deployment Options**: Run locally, in Docker, or integrate into CI/CD pipelines
- **Rich Reporting**: Generates detailed Markdown and HTML reports with severity classification

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Categories Analyzed

The scanner performs analysis across these security domains:

1. **Authentication** - Weak credentials, session management, password policies
2. **Authorization** - Access control, privilege escalation, missing checks
3. **Injection** - SQL injection, command injection, SSTI, XSS
4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS
5. **Data Protection** - Sensitive data exposure, insecure storage/transmission
6. **API Security** - Insecure API design, missing authentication/authorization
7. **Configuration** - Security misconfigurations in frameworks and servers
8. **Cryptography** - Weak algorithms, improper key management, insecure RNG
9. **Client-Side** - JavaScript vulnerabilities, insecure data storage
10. **Business Logic** - Logic flaws, race conditions, validation bypasses

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Google Gemini API key
- OpenAI API key (for embeddings)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adamsmith6300/alder-security-scanner.git
   cd alder-security-scanner
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your API keys:
   # GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   # OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

3. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t alder-security-scanner .
   ```

## üìñ Usage

### Docker Execution

```bash
# Scan a repository using Docker
./local.sh /path/to/your/repository
```

### Docker Script Options

The `local.sh` script builds and runs the scanner in a Docker container with the following features:

- **Automatic Docker image building**: The script builds the image locally on each run
- **Environment variable injection**: Your API keys from `.env` are passed to the container
- **Volume mounting**: The target repository and reports directory are mounted for analysis
- **Report generation**: Security reports are saved to `./security-reports/` directory

### Configuration

You can customize the analysis by modifying the Docker script or the scanner's built-in defaults:

- **Maximum tokens**: 5,000,000 tokens per scan (configurable)
- **Maximum cost**: $5.00 USD per scan (configurable)
- **Ignore patterns**: Common directories like `node_modules`, `dist`, `build` are automatically ignored

## üìä Example Usage Scenarios

### 1. Quick Security Assessment

```bash
# Fast scan of a small project
./local.sh ./my-web-app
```

### 2. Comprehensive Enterprise Scan

```bash
# Full scan of a large codebase
./local.sh ./enterprise-app
```

### 3. Scanning Remote Repositories

```bash
# Clone and scan a repository
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
./local.sh ./repo
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Performance & Cost

- **Analysis Time**: Scans typically take 5-10 minutes for medium-sized codebases, with larger repositories potentially taking longer
- **Cost Estimates**:
  - Small repositories (<500K tokens): Usually under $1
  - Medium repositories (~2M tokens): $1-$4
  - Large repositories (>5M tokens): $5+ (costs are automatically limited to $5.00 by default)
- **Token Limits**: Default maximum of 5M tokens per scan with automatic cost management

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The scanner follows a multi-stage analysis pipeline:

1. **Repository Preparation**: Scans and filters files based on ignore patterns
2. **Code Processing**: Uses Tree-sitter for AST-based code chunking
3. **Vector Indexing**: Creates embeddings for efficient code retrieval
4. **LLM Analysis**: Gemini analyzes code chunks for each security category
5. **Agent Verification**: Multi-agent workflow verifies findings:
   - **Exploitability Agent**: Assesses if vulnerabilities are exploitable
   - **Context Agent**: Analyzes attack scenarios and risk levels
   - **Impact Agent**: Evaluates business impact and consequences
   - **Synthesis Agent**: Combines analyses and provides final recommendations
6. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive reports with verified findings

## Detailed Findings

### Critical Findings

#### 1. SQL injection vulnerability in the `/items/product/:id` endpoint [P0-Critical] üî¥ Exploitable
**Source:** Category: injection
**File:** `app.js:18`
**CWE:** CWE-89
**Verification Status:** Verified By Agent Workflow

**Description:**
SQL injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands due to unsanitized user input in the 'id' parameter.

**üîç Exploitability Analysis:**
- **Status:** Exploitable
- **Confidence:** 90%
- **Reasoning:** The `id` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query without sanitization, allowing arbitrary SQL injection.
- **Data Source Analysis:** User-controlled input from URL path parameter.

**üìä Risk & Impact Analysis:**
- **Risk Level:** High
- **Business Impact:** Critical
- **Attack Scenario:** Attacker can send crafted requests to execute arbitrary SQL commands
- **Potential Consequences:**
  - Complete database compromise
  - Unauthorized data access and modification
  - Service disruption

**Code Snippet:**
```javascript
app.get('/items/product/:id', (req, res) => {
  const id = req.params.id;
  const sql = `SELECT * FROM items WHERE id = ${id}`;
  // Vulnerable: direct concatenation
```

**üîß Remediation Steps:**
1. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements
2. Implement input validation for the 'id' parameter
3. Apply principle of least privilege to database connections

**ü§ñ AI Analysis Summary:**
High-confidence exploitable vulnerability with critical business impact. Immediate remediation required.
